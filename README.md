# Mathematica
This library is useful to perform complex mathematical calculations. 

## Vectors
A vector has magnitude and dimension. The library provides __Vector__ interface, and __ArrayVector__ as it's implementations.
In order to create a vector; both class and interface decide in the package:

```java
package org.katpara.mathematica.linears.vectors;

import org.katpara.mathematica.linears.vectors.Vector;
import org.katpara.mathematica.linears.vectors.ArrayVector;
```

#### To Create a two-dimensional vector:
The easiest way to create a two-dimensional vector is by using the constructor that takes 2 arguments.
```java
Vector v = new ArrayVector(1, 2);
```

#### To Create a three-dimensional vector:
The easiest way to create a three-dimensional vector is by using the constructor that takes 3 arguments.
```java
Vector v = new ArrayVector(1, 2, 3);
```


#### To create a multi-dimensional vector
When you want to create a vector with more than 3 elements, you can create an array of numbers and pass it to the constructor.
You can create a two and three-dimensional constructor using this method but the techniques above, are recommended, since it's easier and used more frequently.
```java
Vector v = new ArrayVector(new Number[]{1, 2, 3, 4});
```

#### To create a vector from a List
<ul>
    <li>It should have at least two elements.
    <li>The List must be a type of java.lang.Number
    <li>It should have non-null values.
</ul>
    
```java
Vector v = new ArrayVector(List.of(1, 2, 3));
```

#### To create a vector from a set
When you create a vector from a set:
<ul>
    <li>It should have at least two elements.
    <li>The Set must be a type of java.lang.Number
    <li>All the elements must be non-null.
</ul>

```java
Vector v = new ArrayVector(Set.of(1, 2, 3));
```

#### To create a vector from a Map
When you create a vector from a map:
<ul>
    <li>It should have at least two key-value pairs.
    <li>Values must be a subclass of java.lang.Number.
    <li>The keys will be ignored and all the values will be used to create a vector.
</ul>

```java
Vector v = new ArrayVector(Map.of("one", 1, "tow", 2, "three", 3));
```

### What can you do with the vector object?
When you create a vector, you can perform following operations

#### To get the dimension of the vector

```java
int dimension = v.getDimension();
```

#### To get the magnitude of a vector | v |

```java
double magnitude = v.getMagnitude();
```

### To get Elements of Vector:
Please note, I rely on JVM to determine the type of the array.
If you pass all integer values, the type of the array is "Integer". etc.
However, I perform all the operations using the double values. So a vector of an integer type, may would result in a vector of double type after some operations. 

```java
Number[] n = v.getElements();
```

### To scale vector up
Please note that this operation is mutable, this will change the elements of the given vector.

| Scalar Condition      |       The output vector                            |
|-----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------:|
| scalar &gt; 1         | It scales up the vector in the same direction.     |
| 0 &lt; scalar &gt; 1  | It shrinks the vector in the same direction.       |
|  scalar = 0           | The scaled vector becomes a zero vector.           |
| -1 &lt; scalar &gt; 0 | It shrinks the vector in the opposite direction.   |
| scalar &lt; -1        | It scales up the vector in the opposite direction. |


```java
v = v.scale(10);
```
